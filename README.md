# ReachFive Identity Android SDK

## Installation

Refer to the [public documentation](https://developer.reach5.co/guides/installation/android/) to install the SDKs and to initialize your ReachFive client.

## Demo application

In addition to the libraries, we provide in the `/app` directory a simple Android application which integrates the ReachFive SDKs.

Clone the repository and import it in your favorite IDE (we advise you to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)).

Since the demo application uses Google services, you need to create a new [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.
Download the `google-services.json` file associated and put it at the root of the `/app` directory.

You also need to set the ReachFive client's domain and client ID in the `/app/src/main/assets/env` file as follow:

```
# formatted as key=value
DOMAIN=my-reachfive-url
CLIENT_ID=my-reachfive-client-id
```

Finally install the dependencies with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (it will be done automatically with Android Studio), select a virtual device and run the application.

## Documentation

You'll find the documentation of the methods exposed on https://developer.reach5.co/api/identity-android.
